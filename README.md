# Bike Sharing Prediction
> We are required to model the demand for a bike sharing company based on the shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

- The dataset is called "day" which has the infomration about day to day demand of bikes and other factor information.


## Conclusions
-The top factors which affect are the following:
1. temp (Temperature): Coefficient = 0.4502. For every one-unit increase in temperature, cnt is expected to increase by approximately 0.4502 units.

2. weathersit_Light Rain or Snow: Coefficient = -0.2886. In light rain or snow weather conditions, cnt is expected to decrease by approximately 0.2886 units.

3. yr (Year): Coefficient = 0.2340 : For each additional year, cnt is expected to increase by approximately 0.2340 units.
